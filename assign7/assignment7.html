<p>I didn't enjoy my first idea, so I changed it to something else. My old idea was about BigFoot being real although, in the end, it didn't catch my attention. My new fictitious truth is that bears are secret martial arts masters. The reason I say this is because of a video game called Tekken, which shows two bears called Kuma and Panda as playable characters. There is also a well-known movie titled Kung-Fu Panda. I just find it coincidental how bears are depicted as agile strong fighters in film and media, which makes me believe bears choose not to show off their fighting moves to other animals or humans because they don't want to hurt them.
