<h1>"10 Reasons why Apple is Better than Andriod"</h1>
</header>    

<p>"Despite the popular belief that Androids are easy to use, iPhones are far better when it comes to retaining and attracting customers since the look and feel of iOS has hardly changed over the years. Whether it’s an old user coming back to iPhone or a new user looking to switch, they can easily navigate through, with the Tips app helping direct users through new features along the way."</p>

 <p>"The fact that iOS users don’t need a third-party application to send messages or conduct an audio/video call over the internet is what makes them stand out. Applications and features like iMessage and FaceTime give an opportunity for users to stay connected with friends and family who are also on iOS devices. The more of your network has an Apple device, the better your communication experience becomes."

<h1>My response on the Matter</h1>    
</header>

<p>In my experience, I found using an Android phone is more straightforward than an iPhone. For instance, the iPhone is limited in terms of affordability. Android phones come in different price points, which makes it easier for people to afford. There is also limited customization when it comes to using an iPhone. Not to mention, the iPhone has a capped storage space depending on the device you bought, and if you want more storage on your iPhone, you have to either upgrade or pay a fee for iCloud storage. Meanwhile, Android phones can easily expand their storage by using microSD cards at a more cost-effective price.</p>
    
<p>While I can't argue that features like iMessage and FaceTime are great for communicating with family and friends, I don't see it being a reason for it to be better than Android phones. Most people connect through social media apps, and everyone doesn't own an iPhone. Another downgrade of the iPhone's messaging and calling system is it not being cross-compatible with Android. Lastly, when sending photos or videos with an iPhone to an Android phone, they tend to be low quality and blurry. </p>
